# AIA Project 1 - Image Classification

This repository contains the code and dataset for the AIA (Applications of Intelligence Artificial) Project 1 - Image Classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

### Description

The dataset contains around 25,000 images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories:

- buildings
- forest
- glacier
- mountain
- sea
- street

The train, test, and prediction data are separated into individual zip files. There are approximately 14,000 images in the train set, 3,000 in the test set, and 7,000 in the prediction set.

This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host an Image Classification Challenge.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone or download the code and dataset files. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.
